# Last Error: One More Chance
Youâ€™re trapped in a loop with one goal: defuse the bomb. No manual, no guidance. Just the ticking clock.   
    
Few things you might want to know before you start:
1. Pen and paper are recommended.
2. All puzzles color coded.
3. To solve some puzzels you need audio.

Have a blast
